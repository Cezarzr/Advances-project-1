# Media Player Application

Welcome to the Media Player Application! This project is a modern media player built with React, designed to provide an interactive and seamless multimedia experience. The app allows users to search for, play, and manage various media files, including videos and music, directly from a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Video Player**: An embedded player to play video content with controls for pause, play, and volume.
- **Channel & Video Details**: View details for videos and channels, including video statistics and channel information.
- **Related Content**: Discover more videos based on your current playback.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is useful if you want to write or run tests for the app's features. For more details, see the section about [running tests](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. It will optimize and bundle the app for the best performance and create a `build` folder. This is the version that should be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back.

If you're looking to customize the build configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject the app. This will copy all the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you can manage them directly. You are no longer limited to the default configuration.
